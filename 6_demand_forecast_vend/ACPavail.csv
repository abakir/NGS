<p>Kheir Misr 100% natural Brown RiceThe reason brown rice has many more nutrients than regular white rice and people in many countries have started replacing white rice with brown rice, is due to the fact that brown rice has only the outer layer, called the hull, removed while white rice has been completely polished and refined . The process to change natural or brown rice to white rice destroys most its nutrients, yet manufacturers still do it for convenience as it makes rice store longer and easier. Next time you start feeling sluggish; reach for brown rice as a source of energy. Brown rice has more than 80% of your daily value of manganese, which gives you energy from both carbs and protein. Manganese also helps synthesize fatty acids, which keeps your nervous system in working order. The fiber in brown rice produces the best health benefit of all; fat burning! In addition to requiring more of your body to break it down, the fiber in brown rice helps satisfy your appetite and therefore decreasing your chances of overeating. That is the equation for fat loss; eat less and burn more! The fiber and selenium found in brown rice can also reduce your risk of many types of cancer, which I?d say is a health benefit we could all use. Finally, Omega oils found in brown rice can help lower cholesterol, which according to research, we eat too much of already. When you cook brown rice, you would need to soak it in water for around 25 minutes to 30 minutes before doing the normal cooking process.?</p>",9.0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0
