It's a blend of sticky pollen granules that could contain up to five million pollen spores each. Raved by many scientists as a super nutritious, perfect food, these tiny pollens contain almost all the nutrients required by the human body and are enormously rich in proteins, vitamins, minerals, beneficial fatty acids, carotenoids, and bioflavonoids which are anti-viral, antibacterial and helpful in lowering cholesterol, stabilizing and strengthening capillaries. Fresh pollens contain a wide spectrum of at least 18 amino acids which are the building blocks of protein needed to build every cell in the body, from blood cell to the cells in the skin, organs and bones. There are also numerous active enzymes present in fresh and unheated pollens. Eating foods that contain enzymes helps the body prevent and fight diseases such as cancer and arthritis and saves the body from having to make enzymes, a process that depletes energy. Applied to the skin, these pollens are also believed to be helpful in healing wounds and acne. Appreciated for years as an excellent weight control, bee pollen is low in calories and contains natural Phenylalanine which acts as appetite suppressant and Lecithin that helps dissolve and flush fat from the body, that is, detoxification and cleansing. Its ability to rejuvenate the body, stimulates organs, enhances vitality and accelerate rate of recovery makes it a popular home remedy and tonic among athletes and sportsmen. Despite the many thousands of chemical analyses conducted in the laboratory with the most advanced diagnostic technology to create a synthetic version, scientists are still unable to identify some elements present in the pollens.

The process to change natural or brown rice to white rice destroys most its nutrients, yet manufacturers still do it for convenience as it makes rice store longer and easier. Next time you start feeling sluggish; reach for brown rice as a source of energy. Brown rice has more than 80% of your daily value of manganese, which gives you energy from both carbs and protein.

That is the equation for fat loss; eat less and burn more! The fiber and selenium found in brown rice can also reduce your risk of many types of cancer, which I?d say is a health benefit we could all use. Finally, Omega oils found in brown rice can help lower cholesterol, which according to research, we eat too much of already.

Brown sugar or raw sugar is that sugar whose production does not involve refining processes. Unlike white or refined sugar, brown sugar is produced directly from sugar cane juice, which is literally boiled and left to cool and crystallize over time. The major characteristic of brown sugar is its brown color and strong taste, which is due to the presence of molasses. Refined sugar can also be turned into brown sugar by simply adding molasses in proportionate amounts. Brown sugar has a lower calorie value mainly because of the presence of water. Brown sugar contains adequate amounts of minerals, yet white sugar contains reduced minerals as a result of refining processes. There has been of late debate on whether there are any health and beauty benefits derived from consumptions and use of brown sugar. While those against brown sugar indicate that brown sugar is the same as white sugar, those for put forward several benefits that accrue.

There is a good reason why many Asian societies have been drinking green tea for hundreds of years. In fact the Chinese have known about the medicinal benefits of green tea since ancient times, using it to treat everything from headaches to depression. In the book; The Natural Secret for a Healthier Life, Nadine Taylor states that green tea has been used as a natural remedy in China for at least 4,000 years. Today, scientific research in both Asia and the west is providing hard evidence for the health benefits long associated with drinking green tea. For example, in 1994 the Journal of the National Cancer Institute published the results of an epidemiological study indicating that drinking green tea reduced the risk of esophageal cancer in Chinese men and women by nearly sixty percent. University of Purdue researchers recently concluded that a compound in green tea inhibits the growth of cancer cells.

Psyllium is an annual plant native to India, although it is now also widely cultivated in France. This weed-like herb is one of the super foods known to us today, and is a vital component of our daily diet. Psyllium lowers blood cholesterol safely and effectively. The soluble fiber in psyllium reduces absorption of blood cholesterol and bile acids from the intestine. It prevents the formation of gallstones and normalizes bowel function in a wide variety of disorders, including constipation, diarrhea, diverticulosis, hemorrhoids and irritable bowel syndrome. Psyllium fiber facilitates weight loss by absorbing extra water from the intestines , and giving a sense of fullness. It also helps stabilize levels of glucose (sugar) in the blood, which may control food cravings. Research showed that diabetics who took two doses before meals had significant decreases in glucose levels. When used as a supplement, psyllium may even be very beneficial to patients suffering from ulcerative colitis. It has been shown to reduce the symptoms and promote longer periods of remission than synthetic drugs used to treat the disease. Psyllium is one of the main ingredients in colon cleansing and detoxification regimens. Colon detoxification can flush years of trapped toxins out of your body. And, these highly poisonous toxins are responsible for many of the diseases and ailments that thousands of people are afflicted with today. It may even deter the development of colon cancer!
